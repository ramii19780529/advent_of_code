# Day 8: Seven Segment Search
# https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/8


# My original approach was to identify the digits that have unique
# segments, then compare segments to narrow down the other digits.
# That approach worked, but I heard about a different technique from
# a crypto developer. In this approach, I calculate the frequency of
# all digit segments in the correct display. Each digit is then
# assigned a number by summing the frequencies of each segment used
# in that digit. This same process can be used to generate numbers for
# the scrambled digit segments from the puzzle and used as a key into
# the one calculated using the correct display.


def get_frequencies(digits):
    # This returns a dict containing the count
    # of each segment across all digits.
    frequencies = {}
    for digit in digits:
        for segment in digit:
            frequencies[segment] = frequencies.get(segment, 0) + 1
    return frequencies


def sum_segments(digit, frequencies):
    # This returns the sum of segment frequencies in the provided digit.
    return sum(frequencies[segment] for segment in digit)


# Parse the puzzle input file.
with open("2021\\day08.txt") as puzzle_input:
    signals = [
        [digits.strip().split(" ") for digits in signal.split("|")]
        for signal in puzzle_input.read().splitlines()
    ]

# This dict holds the correct digit for each group of segments.

# Create the decoder using the segment frequency by summing
# the segment frequency for all segments within each digit.
