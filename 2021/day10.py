# the end of the close_characters list which will be used as a LIFO
# buffer. If the character is not an open chunk characters, I check to
# see if it is a close chunk character that matches the last character
# in the close_caraters list. If is a close chunk character, but it is
# not a match, then we have a corrupted line, so we add to the score of
# part one and clear the list. If a line is not corrupted and the
# close_character list is not empty, then we have an incomplete line, so
# we calculate the score for part two.
