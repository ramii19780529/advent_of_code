# I used this to manually determine the patter matching.
# I would like to do this via code at some point.
# Run the script as-is to generate the output used below.
# Steps:
# 1 - Get the line number where the output starts repeating. I do this by selecting the
#     first line that has an * along with the next 14 lines and I search. If there are
#     no results, I repeat the process starting with the next line having an * until I
#     find the first one that repeats. This line number is the block_start.
# 2 - Next, take difference between the block_start line number and the first line
#     number where it starts to repeat. This is your block_size.
# 3 - Select the text of an entire block and count how many * it contains and multiply
#     that by five. This is your block_rocks.
# Ex: Using the example, the values are:
#        block_start = 26
#        block_height = 79 - 26
#        block_rocks = 7 * 5
